TileDirect EasySample is a platform built to simplify how tile samples are managed and tracked. It lets sales teams check samples out to customers effortlessly, keeps tabs on inventory to prevent loss, and helps them follow up with customers at the right time—knowing exactly which tiles caught their attention. Customers can scan samples to explore more details online, see how tiles look in augmented reality, and get automated reminders for returns or care instructions.

The front end is built with Next.js, using shadcn/ui for styling and modern React Redux to manage state. On the backend, I used .NET Core with a PostgreSQL database, structured around an event-driven architecture. It’s hosted on Vercel, fly.io and Amazon AWS.
